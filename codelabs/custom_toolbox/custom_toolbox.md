# Customizing a Blockly toolbox

## Codelab overview

### What you'll learn
This codelab will focus on customizing the Blockly toolbox.

In this codelab you will learn:
1. How to add a background color to a toolbox category.
1. How to change the look of a selected category.
1. How to add a custom CSS classes to a toolbox category.
1. How to change the structure of your category HTML.
1. How to add a custom toolbox item.

### What you'll build

Over the course of this codelab you will customize your toolbox categories as well
as create a custom toolbox item.
The resulting toolbox is shown below.

The code samples are written in ES6 syntax. You can find the code for the [completed custom toolbox](https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/tree/master/examples/custom-toolbox-codelab/complete-code/index.html) on GitHub.

### What you'll need
- A browser.
- A text editor.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of the [Blockly toolbox](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/toolbox).

Throughout various parts of this codelab we will be talking about [toolbox definitions](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/toolbox#xml).
The toolbox definition can be written in XML or JSON. We will be using an XML
toolbox definition that can be found in the provided code.

## Setup

### Download the sample code
You can get the sample code for this codelab by either downloading the zip here:

[Download zip](https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/archive/master.zip)

or by cloning this git repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/blockly-samples.git
```

If you downloaded the source as a zip, unpacking it should give you a root folder named `blockly-samples-master`.

The relevant files are in `examples/custom-toolbox-codelab`. There are two versions of the app:
- `starter-code/`: The starter code that you'll build upon in this codelab.
- `complete-code/`: The code after completing the codelab, in case you get lost or want to compare to your version.

Each folder contains:
- `index.js` - The codelab's logic. To start, it just injects a simple workspace.
- `index.html` - A web page containing a simple blockly workspace.

To run the code, simply open `starter-code/index.html` in a browser. You should see a Blockly workspace with a toolbox.

![A web page with the text "Toolbox Customization Codelab" and a Blockly workspace.](starter_workspace.png)

### Define and register a custom category
To start, create a file named `custom_category.js` in the `starter-code`
directory. Include your new file by adding a script tag to `index.html`.

```html
<script src="custom_category.js"></script>
```

In order to create a custom category we will create a new category that extends
the default `Blockly.ToolboxCategory` class. Add the following code to your
`custom_category.js` file.
```js
class CustomCategory extends Blockly.ToolboxCategory {
  /**
   * Constructor for a custom category.
   * @override
   */
  constructor(categoryDef, toolbox, opt_parent) {
    super(categoryDef, toolbox, opt_parent);
  }
}
```

After defining your category you need to tell Blockly that it exists.
Register your category by adding the below code to the end of `custom_category.js`.
```js
Blockly.registry.register(
    Blockly.registry.Type.TOOLBOX_ITEM,
    Blockly.ToolboxCategory.registrationName,
    CustomCategory, true);
```
By registering our `CustomCategory` with `Blockly.ToolboxCategory.registrationName`
we are overriding the default category in Blockly. Because we are overriding a
toolbox item instead of adding a new one, we must pass in `true` as the last
argument. If this flag is `false`, `Blockly.registry.register` will throw
an error because we are overriding an existing class.

### The result

To test, open `index.html` in a browser. Your toolbox should look the same as it
did before.

![The default toolbox. A list of categories with a strip of colour to the left.](./base_toolbox.png)

However, if you run the below commands in your console you will see that
your toolbox is now using the `CustomCategory` class.

```js
var toolbox = Blockly.common.getMainWorkspace().getToolbox();
toolbox.getToolboxItems()[0];
```

## Change the look of a category

### Change the background of the category

In the default `ToolboxCategory` class, the `addColourBorder_` method adds a strip of color next
to the category name. We can override this method in order to add colour to the entire category div.

Add the following code to your `CustomCategory` class.
```js
/** @override */
addColourBorder_(colour){
  this.rowDiv_.style.backgroundColor = colour;
}
```
The `colour` passed in is calculated from either the `categorystyle` or the `colour`
attribute set on the category definition.

For example, the "Logic" category definition looks like:
```xml
<category name="Logic" categorystyle="logic_category">
...
</category>
```

The logic_category style looks like:

```json
"logic_category": {
    "colour": "210"
  }
```
For more information on Blockly styles please visit the [themes documentation](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/themes#category_style).

### Add some CSS

Open `index.html` to see your updated toolbox. Your toolbox should look
similar to the below toolbox.

![A toolbox with colors that expand the across the entire category.](./colored_toolbox.png)

We are going to add some CSS to make it easier to read, and to space out our categories.

Create a file named `toolbox_style.css` in the same directory as `index.html`
and include it in `index.html`:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="toolbox_style.css">
```

Copy and paste the following CSS into your `toolbox_style.css` file.
```css
/* Makes our label white. */
.blocklyToolboxCategoryLabel {
  color: white;
}
/* Adds padding around the group of categories and separators. */
.blocklyToolboxContents {
  padding: 0.5em;
}
/* Adds space between the categories, rounds the corners and adds space around the label. */
.blocklyToolboxCategory {
  padding: 3px;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### The result

Open `index.html` to see your toolbox.

![Toolbox with category corners that are rounded and white text.](./styled_toolbox.png)

## Change the look of a selected category

Open your `index.html` and click on a category. You will see that it
doesn't give any indication that it has been clicked. Worse than that, if you
click on the category a second time the background color will disappear.

To fix this, we are going to override the `setSelected` method to change the look
of a category when it has been clicked. In the default category class this method
adds a colour to the entire row when a category is selected. Since we have already
expanded the colour over our entire div, we are going to change the background
color of the div to white, and the text to the color of the category when it has
been selected.

Add the following code to `custom_category.js`:
```js
/** @override */
setSelected(isSelected){
   // We do not store the label span on the category, so use getElementsByClassName.
   var labelDom = this.rowDiv_.getElementsByClassName('blocklyToolboxCategoryLabel')[0];
   if (isSelected) {
     // Change the background color of the div to white.
     this.rowDiv_.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
     // Set the colour of the text to the colour of the category.
     labelDom.style.color = this.colour_;
   } else {
     // Set the background back to the original colour.
     this.rowDiv_.style.backgroundColor = this.colour_;
     // Set the text back to white.
     labelDom.style.color = 'white';
   }
   // This is used for accessibility purposes.
   Blockly.utils.aria.setState(/** @type {!Element} */ (this.htmlDiv_),
       Blockly.utils.aria.State.SELECTED, isSelected);
}
```

### The result
Open `index.html` and click on the "Logic" category. You should now see a white
category with a colored label.

![A toolbox with all categories colored except for the first category that has a white background.](./category_selected.png)

## Add an icon to your category

We are going to add an icon to our "Logic" category by adding an icon library to
our `index.html` file, and  setting the appropriate CSS class on our category definition.

To start, we are going to grab an icon library and add it to `index.html`:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```
We are going to add a cog icon from this library to the "Logic" category.
To do this, we will add the appropriate CSS classes to our category definition.

In `index.html` scroll down to your toolbox definition and change the below line:
```xml
<category name="Logic" categorystyle="logic_category">
```
to be:
```xml
<category css-icon="customIcon fa fa-cog" name="Logic" categorystyle="logic_category">
```
All the classes used to create a category can be set similar to how we set the
icon class above. See the [Blockly toolbox documentation](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/toolbox#category_css) for more information.

### Add some CSS
If you open `index.html` you will notice that the gear icon is positioned
incorrectly and is a bit difficult to see. We will use the `customIcon` class to
change the color of the icon and use the `blocklyTreeRowContentContainer` class
to position the icon above the text.

In your `toolbox_style.css` file add:
```css
/* Changes color of the icon to white. */
.customIcon {
  color: white;
}
/* Stacks the icon on top of the label. */
.blocklyTreeRowContentContainer {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
.blocklyToolboxCategory {
  height: initial;
}
```

### Update setSelected
If you open `index.html` and click on the "Logic" category you will notice
that the white icon now blends into the white background.

In order to fix this, we are going to update our `setSelected` method to set the
color of the icon to the category color when the category has been selected.

Inside `custom_category.js` add the below line to `setSelected` if the category
has been selected:

```js
this.iconDom_.style.color = this.colour_;
```

Add the below line to `setSelected` if the category has not been selected:
```js
this.iconDom_.style.color = 'white';
```

Your `setSelected` method should look similar to below:
```js
  /** @override */
  setSelected(isSelected){
     // We do not store the label span on the category, so use getElementsByClassName.
     var labelDom = this.rowDiv_.getElementsByClassName('blocklyToolboxCategoryLabel')[0];
     if (isSelected) {
       // Change the background color of the div to white.
       this.rowDiv_.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
       // Set the colour of the text to the colour of the category.
       labelDom.style.color = this.colour_;
       this.iconDom_.style.color = this.colour_;
     } else {
       // Set the background back to the original colour.
       this.rowDiv_.style.backgroundColor = this.colour_;
       // Set the text back to white.
       labelDom.style.color = 'white';
       this.iconDom_.style.color = 'white';
     }
     // This is used for accessibility purposes.
     Blockly.utils.aria.setState(/** @type {!Element} */ (this.htmlDiv_),
         Blockly.utils.aria.State.SELECTED, isSelected);
  }
```
### The result
If you open your `index.html` file, you should see a white gear above your "Logic"
label, and it should change to blue when the category has been selected.

![A white gear above the word "Logic" on a blue background.](./category_gear.png)

![A blue gear above the word "Logic" on a white background.](./category_gear_selected.png)

## Change the category HTML
If you only need to change the CSS, like we did in the previous section, then using the cssConfig is a great choice.
However, if you need to change the html, maybe to add text, an image, or anything else, you can override
the corresponding method that creates the dom. In this example, we'll add an `<img>`
to our category by overriding the `createIconDom_` method.

### Change the element for our icon
By default, the `createIconDom_` method adds a `<span>` element for the category
icon. We can override this to return an `<img>` element.

Add the following methods to `custom_category.js`:
```js
/** @override */
createIconDom_() {
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = './logo_only.svg';
  img.alt = 'Lamp';
  img.width='15';
  img.height='15';
  return img;
}
```

### The result
If you open `index.html` you should now see the blockly logo on top of all your
categories

![A toolbox with the blockly logo on top of the category label.](./image_toolbox.png)

## Adding a custom toolbox item
In the previous sections we modified the toolbox by extending the base category class.
In this section we will make a completely new toolbox item and add it to our toolbox.

For this example, we are going to create a toolbox label.

### Setup
In the same directory as `index.html` create a new file named `toolbox_label.js`.

Include this file in `index.html`:
```html
<script src="toolbox_label.js"></script>
```

Create a class in `toolbox_label.js` that extends `Blockly.ToolboxItem`
and register it.

```js
class ToolboxLabel extends Blockly.ToolboxItem {
  constructor(toolboxItemDef, parentToolbox) {
    super(toolboxItemDef, parentToolbox);
  }
}

Blockly.registry.register(
    Blockly.registry.Type.TOOLBOX_ITEM,
    'toolboxlabel',
    ToolboxLabel);
```
By registering this toolbox item with the name "toolboxlabel" we can now use this
name in our toolbox definition to add our custom item to the toolbox.

Navigate to `index.html`, and scroll down to the toolbox definition. Add a
`<toolboxlabel>` element as the first item in your toolbox definition:
```xml
<toolboxlabel></toolboxlabel>
```

Your toolbox definition should now look something like:
```xml
<xml xmlns="https://developers.google.com/blockly/xml" id="toolbox-categories" style="display: none">
<toolboxlabel></toolboxlabel>
<category css-icon="customIcon fa fa-cog" name="Logic" categorystyle="logic_category">
...
</xml>
```

### Initialize the toolbox item
In order to create a toolbox item we must implement one of the toolbox item interfaces.

For this example, we will be implementing the basic `IToolboxItem` interface.
There are three different types of toolbox item interfaces:
`IToolboxItem`, `ISelectableToobloxItem` and `ICollapsibleToolboxItem`.
Since we do not need our label to be selectable or collapsible, we can implement
the basic `IToolboxItem` interface.

First, we are going to add an init method that will create the dom for our toolbox label:
```js
  /** @override */
  init() {
    // Create the label.
    this.label = document.createElement('label');
    // Set the name.
    this.label.textContent = 'Label';
  }
```

Next, we are going to return this element:

```js
  /** @override */
  getDiv() {
    return this.label;
  }
```

If you open the `index.html` file you should see a label above your first category.

![The toolbox with a label at the top.](./toolbox_label.png)

### Add attributes to the toolbox definition
The above code is rather limiting since it only allows us to create a toolbox
label with the text "Label".
To make it possible to create different labels with different text and colour we
are going to add `name` and `colour` attributes to our toolbox definition.

Open `index.html` and navigate to the toolbox definition. Change your
`toolboxlabel` element to look like the below line:
```xml
<toolboxlabel name="Custom Toolbox" colour="darkslategrey"></toolboxlabel>
```

These values will get passed in to our `ToolboxLabel` class through the `toolboxItemDef`.
Navigate to `toolbox_label.js` and add the following lines to your `init` method:

```js
// Set the name.
this.label.textContent = this.toolboxItemDef_['name'];
// Set the color.
this.label.style.color = this.toolboxItemDef_['colour'];
```

Remove the following line from your init method:
```js
this.label.textContent = 'Label';
```

All attributes on our toolbox definition get added to the `toolboxItemDef_`.
`this.toolboxItemDef_` is set in the `Blockly.ToolboxItem` constructor.

Open your `index.html` in a browser to see the updated label.

![The toolbox with a label that now says "Custom Toolbox".](./custom_label.png)
### Add some CSS
Similar to how we added `colour` and `name` above, we are going to add a custom
class to our label.

Navigate to your toolbox definition in `index.html` and modify it to look
like the below line.

```xml
<toolboxlabel name="Label" colour="darkslategrey" css-label="customLabel"></toolboxlabel>
```

Any item that begins with `css-` will be added to a `cssconfig` object stored on
the `toolboxItemDef`.

To use this value navigate to `toolbox_label.js` and add the following lines to
your `init` method.

```js
// Any attributes that begin with css- will get added to a cssconfig object.
const cssConfig = this.toolboxItemDef_['cssconfig'];
// Add the class.
if (cssConfig) {
  this.label.classList.add(cssConfig['label']);
}
```

The above code will add the class to the label. Now, in `toolbox_style.css` add
the below CSS to make the label bold.
```css
.customLabel {
   font-weight: bold;
}
```

### The result
If you open `index.html` you should now see a bold dark gray label at the
top of your toolbox.
