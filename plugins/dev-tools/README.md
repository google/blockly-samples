# @blockly/dev-tools [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

A library of helpful tools for Blockly development.

## Installation

```
npm install @blockly/dev-tools -D --save
```

## Usage

### Playground
The playground is a tremendously useful tool for debugging your Blockly project. As a preview, here is [one of the plugin playgrounds](https://google.github.io/blockly-samples/plugins/theme-modern/test/). The playground features are:
- All the default blocks
- All the language generators (JavaScript, Python, PHP, Lua, and Dart)
- Switch between different Blockly options (eg: rtl, renderer, readOnly, zoom and scroll)
- Switch between different toolboxes and themes
- Import and export programs, or generate code using one of the built-in generators
- Trigger programmatic actions (eg: Show/hide, Clear, Undo/Redo, Scale)
- A debug renderer
- Stress tests for the renderer
- Log all events in the console

```js
import {createPlayground} from '@blockly/dev-tools';

const defaultOptions = {
  ...
};
createPlayground(document.getElementById('blocklyDiv'), (blocklyDiv, options) => {
  return Blockly.inject(blocklyDiv, options);
}, defaultOptions);
```

This package also exports pieces of the playground (addGUIControls, addCodeEditor) if you'd rather build your own playground.

### Toolboxes
Blockly built-in Simple and Category toolboxes.

```js
import * as Blockly from 'blockly';
import {toolboxSimple, toolboxCategories} from '@blockly/dev-tools';

Blockly.inject('blocklyDiv', {
  toolbox: toolboxCategories
});
```

#### Test Toolbox

The test toolbox is re-exported in this package, but can be imported as a stand-alone through [@blockly/block-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockly/block-test). See the README for details.

### Helpers

#### `populateRandom`

The `populateRandom` function adds random blocks to a workspace. Blocks are selected from the full set of defined blocks. Pass in a worskpace and how many blocks should be created.
```js
import {populateRandom} from '@blockly/dev-tools';
// Add 10 random blocks to the workspace.
populateRandom(workspace, 10);
```

#### `spaghetti`

The `spaghetti` function is a renderer stress test that populates the workspace with nested if-statements. Pass in a worskpace and how deep the nesting should be.
```js
import {spaghetti} from '@blockly/dev-tools';
spaghetti(workspace, 8);
```

#### `generateFieldTestBlocks`

The `generateFieldTestBlocks` function automatically generates a number of field testing blocks for the passed-in field. This is useful for testing field plugins.

```js
import {generateFieldTestBlocks} from '@blockly/dev-tools';

const toolbox = generateFieldTestBlocks('field_template', [
  {
    'args': {
      'value': 0, // default value
    },
  },
]);
```

### Test Helpers

This package is also used in mocha tests, and exports a suite of useful test helpers.
You can find the full list of helpers [here](https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/blob/master/plugins/dev-tools/src/test_helpers.mocha.js).

### Debug Renderer
The debug renderer is a helpful tool to debug blocks when building a custom renderer. 

```js
import {DebugRenderer} from '@blockly/dev-tools';
// Initialize the debug renderer.
DebugRenderer.init();
```

The debug renderer is included by default in the playground.

### Logger
A lightweight workspace console logger. 

```js
import {logger} from '@blockly/dev-tools';

logger.enableLogger(workspace);
logger.disableLogger(workspace);
```

The logger is included by default in the playground.
