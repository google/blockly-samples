# @blockly/workspace-backpack [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

A [Blockly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockly) plugin that adds a Backpack to the workspace.

## Installation

### Yarn
```
yarn add @blockly/workspace-backpack
```

### npm
```
npm install @blockly/workspace-backpack --save
```
## Features
### Context Menus
The following context menu options are available for the backpack:
- "Copy all Blocks" to Backpack in main Workspace
- "Paste all Blocks" from Backpack in main Workspace
- "Remove from Backpack" on Block stack in Backpack Flyout
- "Copy to Backpack" on a Block stack in main Workspace
- "Empty" option when right clicking the Backpack that is disabled if the Backpack is empty

## Usage

```js
import * as Blockly from 'blockly';
import {Backpack} from '@blockly/workspace-backpack';

// Inject Blockly.
const workspace = Blockly.inject('blocklyDiv', {
  toolbox: toolboxCategories,
});

// Initialize plugin.
const backpack = new Backpack(workspace);
backpack.init();
```

### Configuration
This plugin takes an optional configuration object.
```
{
  allowEmptyBackpackOpen: (boolean|undefined),
  useFilledBackpackImage: (boolean|undefined),
  contextMenu: {
    emptyBackpack: (boolean|undefined),
    removeFromBackpack: (boolean|undefined),
    copyToBackpack: (boolean|undefined),
    copyAllToBackpack: (boolean|undefined),
    pasteAllToBackpack: (boolean|undefined),
    disablePreconditionChecks: (boolean|undefined),
  },
}
```

The configuration options are passed in to the constructor. In this
configuration object, you can currently configure which context menu options are
registered at `init`.
```js
const backpackOptions = {
  allowEmptyBackpackOpen: true,
  useFilledBackpackImage: true,
  contextMenu: {
    emptyBackpack: true,
    removeFromBackpack: true,
    copyToBackpack: false,
  },
};
const backpack = new Backpack(workspace,  backpackOptions);
```

The following options are the default values used for any property in the
passed in options that is undefined:
```js
const defaultOptions = {
  allowEmptyBackpackOpen: true,
  useFilledBackpackImage: false,
  contextMenu: {
    emptyBackpack: true,
    removeFromBackpack: true,
    copyToBackpack: true,
    copyAllToBackpack: false,
    pasteAllToBackpack: false,
    disablePreconditionChecks: false,
  },
};
```

The `allowEmptyBackpackOpen` property, if set to `false`, will prevent the backpack flyout from
being opened if the backpack is empty.

The `useFilledBackpackImage` property, if set to `true`, will change the
backpack image when the backpack has something in it.

The `disablePreconditionChecks` property will prevent the "Copy to Backpack"
context menu option from disabling the context menu option if the block is
already in the Backpack. Setting this flag to `true` to disable the check can be
beneficial for performance if you expect blocks stacks to be very large.

Note: Currently the empty Backpack context menu is registered globally, while
the others are registered per workspace.

### Blockly Languages
We do not currently support translating the text in this plugin to different
languages. However, if you would like to support multiple languages the messages
can be translated by assigning the following properties of Blockly.Msg
- `EMPTY_BACKPACK` (Default: "Empty") context menu - Empty the backpack.
- `REMOVE_FROM_BACKPACK` (Default: "Remove from Backpack") context menu - Remove
the selected Block from the backpack.
- `COPY_TO_BACKPACK` (Default: "Copy to Backpack") context menu - Copy the
selected Block to the backpack.
- `COPY_ALL_TO_BACKPACK` (Default: "Copy All Blocks to Backpack") Context menu -
copy all Blocks on the workspace to the backpack.
- `PASTE_ALL_FROM_BACKPACK` (Default: "Paste All Blocks from Backpack") context
menu - Paste all Blocks from the backpack to the workspace.

```javascript
Blockly.Msg['EMPTY_BACKPACK'] = 'Opróżnij plecak';  // Polish 
// Inject workspace, etc...
```

## API

- `init`: Initializes the backpack.
- `dispose`: Disposes of backpack.

- `getCount`: Returns the count of items in the backpack.
- `getContents` Returns backpack contents.
- `empty`: Empties the backpack's contents. If the contents-flyout is currently
open it will be closed.
- `addBlock`: Adds Block to backpack.
- `addBlocks`: Adds Blocks to backpack.
- `removeBlock`: Removes Block to backpack.
- `addItem`: Adds item to backpack.
- `removeItem`: Removes item from the backpack.
- `setContents`: Sets backpack contents.

- `isOpen`: Returns whether the backpack is open.
- `open`: Opens the backpack flyout.
- `close`: Closes the backpack flyout.

- `handleBlockDrop`: Handles a block drop on this backpack.
- `onDragEnter`: Handle mouse over.
- `onDragExit`: Handle mouse exit.

- `getBoundingRectangle`: Returns the bounding rectangle of the UI element in
pixel units relative to the Blockly injection div.
- `position`: Positions the backpack UI element.

## Compatibility

### Multiple Backpacks per Workspace
This plugin also currently only supports one Backpack per Workspace.

### Blockly.configureContextMenu
This plugin registers a custom context menu by overriding
`Blockly.configureContextMenu` in `init` in order to support the context menu
for emptying the Backpack.
If you also override `Blockly.configureContextMenu` after initializing this
plugin, you must also call the old `Blockly.configureContextMenu` function.
Example:
```
const prevConfigureContextMenu = workspace.configureContextMenu;
workspace.configureContextMenu = (menuOptions, e) => {
  prevConfigureContextMenu &&
      prevConfigureContextMenu.call(null, menuOptions, e);
  ...
}      
```

### Backpack Flyout
The Backpack Flyout uses the registered Flyout for either
`Blockly.registry.Type.FLYOUTS_HORIZONTAL_TOOLBOX` or
`Blockly.registry.Type.FLYOUTS_VERTICAL_TOOLBOX`, similar to the implementation
for `Blockly.Trashcan`. If a custom class is registered for either of these
types, then the Backpack Flyout may need to be tested for compatibility.
